Projects I worked on during these year. After getting burned and having my 2020-2021 projects deleted.
# Installation
You need to have nodejs installed. In every place where there is a packagefile you need to do an npm install.
To start a express server you do npm start.
To start a vue server you do a npm run dev.
#Usage
