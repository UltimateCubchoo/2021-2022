        A management system is a set of policies, processes and procedures used by
        an organization to ensure that it can fulfill the tasks required to
        achieve its objectives.[1] These objectives cover many aspects of the
        organization's operations (including financial success, safe operation,
        product quality, client relationships, legislative and regulatory
        conformance and worker management). For instance, an environmental
        management system enables organizations to improve their environmental
        performance, and an occupational safety and health management system
        enables an organization to control its occupational health and safety
        risks. The international standard ISO 9000:2015 (Title: Quality management
        systems - fundamentals and vocabulary) defines the term in chapter 3.5.3
        as a "set of interrelated or interacting elements of an organization to
        establish policies and objectives, and processes to achieve those
        objectives".[2] A simplification of the main aspects of a management
        system is the 4-element "plan, do, check, act" approach. A complete
        management system covers every aspect of management and focuses on
        supporting the performance management to achieve the objectives. The
        management system should be subject to continuous improvement as the
        organization learns.
